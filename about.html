                    Biju's Little Curry Shop was founded by chef and serial entreprenuer Biju Thomas. He lived in India for 10 years before he moved to the U.S. He quickly fell in love with the culinary arts and also picked up a passion for cycling. His business ventures included making nutritious meals for high performance athletes and founding Biju's little curry shop. He is currently hosting a travel show called, "The Road Less Eaten" on OutsideTV.

                    Our story starts in Denver where we came up with an idea for a new kind of Indian restaurant. After so many years, it was simply shocking that a fast casual indian restaurant like Biju's hadn't ever been opened. Thomas took it into his own hands to open a small fast casual Indian chain to the U.S. and opened his first little curry shop in RiNo. The business quickly expanded to open locations in Berkley and Broadway Market along with pop-ups in some Whole Foods.
